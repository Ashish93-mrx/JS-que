In JavaScript, var, let, and const are used to declare variables, but they have some key differences. Here's a concise way to explain the differences:

Scope:

var is function-scoped, which means it is only visible within the function where it is declared.
let and const are block-scoped, limiting their visibility to the block (enclosed by curly braces) in which they are defined, such as loops or conditional statements.
Hoisting:

var declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope, so they can be used before they are declared. However, their assignments are not hoisted.
let and const declarations are also hoisted, but they are not initialized until the interpreter reaches the line where they are declared. Accessing them before the declaration results in a ReferenceError.
Reassignment:

Variables declared with var can be redeclared and reassigned.
Variables declared with let can be reassigned but not redeclared within the same scope.
Variables declared with const cannot be reassigned or redeclared after initialization. However, note that for objects and arrays declared with const, the properties or elements can still be modified.
Here's an example answer:

Use var when you need a variable with function scope or when working with older code.
Prefer let when you need a variable with block scope and you might need to reassign its value.
Use const when you want a variable with block scope and a value that should not be reassigned after initialization.
